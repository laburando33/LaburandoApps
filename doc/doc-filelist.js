var _tree = []

// rest of the code will go here.  This is a placeholder.  A real doc-filelist.js would have more code.
// For example, it might populate the _tree array with file information.

// Example of populating the _tree array:
_tree.push({ name: "index.html", path: "/docs/index.html" })
_tree.push({ name: "about.html", path: "/docs/about.html" })
